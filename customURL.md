# Sigma Games Custom URL
Something that Sigma Games presents that no other game website has is a Custon URL feature. This feature allows you to use your own custom URL to play whatever game you would like to play. This means that you can play games that we don't even have listed. Here's how it works.

## 1. Find a game
You can find games most likely in the [SZ Games "Games" Repositories](https://github.com/sz-games/Games).

## 2. Find a link
For this test, I'm going to use the repo sz-games/Games.

## 3. Get the link
Most websites will be hosted with GitHub Pages. You can find the GitHub pages link using this format: https://username.github.io/repository-case-sensitive/folders-and-files.extension

## 4. Hacker Typer
If I want to play Hacker Typer, I can use the link https://sz-games.github.io/Games/Hacker-Typer/, which will automatically redirect to the index.html page.

## 5. Enter it into the Custom URL Dashboard
Go to the [Custom URL Dashboard](https://sigmasec.me/games/customurl and we can enter in the Hacker Typer URL.

## 6. Profit.
There you go, you've offically went to your own custom game URL!
