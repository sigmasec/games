# Trusted URLs
Sigma Games trusts only some URLs because they are awesome. Here's a quick guide on our Trusted URLs.<br><br>

We have 3 rankings of URLs. The three rankings are: Sigma, Kinda Sigma, and Not Sigma.

## Rankings
### Sigma
Sigma is our highest trusted URLs. They are usually URLs made by Sigma Games themselves.

### Kinda Sigma
Kinda Sigma is URLs that we trust but we don't make, endorse, or fully trust.

### Not Sigma
Not Sigma is URLs that we do not trust at all, usually because we don't have a fork of the repo, or it is easily changable to have malware by the owner.
